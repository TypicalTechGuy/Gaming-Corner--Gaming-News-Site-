        <h1>CS2 Pros Criticize Valve Slow Update Phase</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">Written by John Doe | Published on September 23, 2024</p>
        <img src="../img/articleImage/cs2.jpg" alt="PC Games">
        <p>It has been nearly a year since the release of Valve’s Counter-Strike 2 (CS2), and the professional community remains divided on its current state. While excitement surrounded its launch as the successor to CS, many CS2 Pros are voicing frustration over the game’s development. Pro are particularly disappointed with Valve’s slow pace in rolling out major updates. This has lead some to speculate that the game won’t reach its peak until as late as 2030.
        </p>
        <p>
            When CS2 fully launched in 2023, it arrived with high expectations. Especially, as it was showcased at major tournaments like IEM Sydney. However, the early excitement quickly turned into disappointment for many. Players and professionals critiquing everything from in-game mechanics to performance issues. One of the most significant points of contention remains the subtick system, which continues to operate at 64-tick, a feature many pros feel is inferior to the 128-tick servers they prefer for competitive play.
        </p>
        <p>
            FaZe Clan’s star player, ropz, recently shared his thoughts in an interview with Blast.TV. The CS2 Pro expressed his dissatisfaction with the current state of the game, citing both the subtick system and overall FPS performance as areas where Valve could significantly improve. While comparing the transition from CS to CS2 with previous transitions in the franchise, ropz didn’t hold back his criticism. “The game is alright if you compare it to transitions back in the day, like when CS was released. But I feel like Valve could do a lot better than this,” he said. When asked when he believes the game will match CS’s competitive level, ropz gave a blunt response: “Not sure, but I’d guess the game will be great by 2030.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The dissatisfaction extends beyond just ropz. G2 Esports’ NiKo, another top-tier CS2 Pro, echoed similar concerns. In his own interview with Blast.TV, NiKo didn’t mince words, expressing disappointment with how Valve has handled CS2’s development. “It’s pretty sad that with a new game, we’ve taken a step back instead of two steps forward,” NiKo remarked, highlighting that nearly a year has passed with minimal progress or substantial updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the main issues is Valve’s slow approach to addressing feedback from the player base. Players have noted that some patches are alarmingly sparse, with updates as minor as a single line of changes. This has led to widespread speculation that Valve is not prioritizing CS2 improvements. Potentially, Valve is focusing on other projects like Deadlock, a game that has recently drawn the attention of the developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This growing frustration among CS2 Pros is worsened by the fact that CS2 raised the bar for expectations. CS2 has yet to demonstrate the same level of stability, performance, and competitive balance that made CS a mainstay in esports.
